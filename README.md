# 42028-Deep-Learning-and-CNN

This is our group project for our Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network class.


After brainstorming many ideas and getting advice from the lecturer, 
we have settled on creating an image classification AI program that takes an image of a part of your body. 

You are given a choice of uploading a white background image of a tattoo or selecting a design from the uploaded designs.
You can then click and drag the tattoo onto the body. 

Once the model has finished computing, it will display the tattoo on the selected part of the body and provide the option of saving the image.

The goal of this project is to be able to provide tattoo artists and users the ability to show and
see what a completed tattoo can look like on their bodies. We will use computer vision to achieve our goal.
